# VirtualLeaf

VirtualLeaf is a cell-based computer modeling framework for simulating plant tissue morphogenesis.

## What is it?

**VirtualLeaf** is a cell-based tissue simulation software written in C++. It simulates tissue dynamics through dicreet steps, minimizing the system energy using a Monte-carlo approach. This method generates realistic cell shapes and emergent tissue behaviors, allowing users to model a wide range of developmental proccesses in plants.  
At its core, cell shape is defined through a balance between **turgor pressure**, which drives expansion, and **cell wall tension**, which restricts it. By modeling cell walls as springs that resist the internal pressure, a mathematical description for the systems energy, known as the Hamiltonian, can be obtained. This expression can also be extended to include additional constraints, that the user defines (e.g. cell shape).  
VirtualLeaf also supports **compartmentalized ODE-based simulations**, enabling interactions between biochemical processes and physical properties of cells.  
These features make VirtualLeaf a powerful tool for exploring and understanding how plants grow and develop. Give it a try!
